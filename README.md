# Custom-Task-Custom-Task-Pool
A C# program to run several tasks sequentially (but parallel to the main thread) and executed in the order that they were added to the class


##This C# program tries to solve the following challenge:

Write a C# class to execute a number of pieces of work (actions) in the background (i.e. without blocking the program’s execution).
•	The actions must be executed sequentially – one at a time
•	The actions must be executed in the order that they were added to the class
•	The actions are not necessarily added all at the same time
•	The actions are not necessarily all executed on the same thread

After completion, please let us know whether this was something you already knew how to do, or if you had to research it.  There isn’t a correct answer to this, but if you did research it, tell us how did you went about finding the information you needed.
